#1. Product Review Analysis

    #Objective: 
         #The aim of this assignment is to extract insights from product reviews by using string manipulation to categorize and summarize customer feedback for a SaaS product.

#Task 1: Keyword Highlighter
   #Write a program that searches through a series of product reviews for keywords such as "good", "excellent", "bad", "poor", and "average". Print out each review with the keywords in uppercase so they stand out.

   # python_reviews = [ "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.", "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!", "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.", "This was a poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.", "The product was average. Nothing extraordinary about it." ]

#Task 2: Sentiment Tally

    #Develop a function that tallies the number of positive and negative words in each review. Use a predefined list of positive and negative words to check against. The function should return the count of positive and negative words for each review.

    #python_positive_words = ["good", "excellent", "great", "awesome", "fantastic", "superb", "amazing"] negative_words = ["bad", "poor", "terrible", "horrible", "awful", "disappointing", "subpar"]

#Task 3: Review Summary

    #Implement a function that takes the first 30 characters of a review and appends "…" to create a summary. 
    #      (BONUS) Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.
